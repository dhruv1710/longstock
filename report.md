The second search was slightly better but still did not yield a clear, consolidated list of P/S and EV/Sales multiples for listed Indian EV or automotive peers.
One search result mentions Tata Motors and shows its P/S as 0.6x and P/B as 2.7x. Another mentions TVS Motors sales figures in comparison to Ola Electric. These are potential peers, but getting a broader average or a range is difficult with the current search results. The Kroll reports seem relevant but are PDFs that I cannot access the content of directly via snippets. The NYU Stern link provides US sector multiples, which are not ideal comparables for the Indian market.

Given the limitations of the search tool and the available data (only 3 years, some inconsistencies/missing data like precise D&A), a full, robust peer comparison and historical analysis (for Ola Electric itself) is not possible.

However, I can still provide a valuation analysis based on Ola Electric's calculated multiples and make a qualitative comparison based on the limited peer data found (Tata Motors P/S of 0.6x) and the understanding of Ola Electric's rapid growth vs. peers who are likely larger, more established, profitable automotive companies transitioning to EV.

Here's how I will structure the final answer:
1.  State the calculated valuation metrics for Ola Electric (P/S, EV/Sales, P/B, N/A for P/E, EV/EBITDA, P/FCF, EV/FCF).
2.  Address the historical comparison limitation (only 3 years data for Ola Electric).
3.  Provide the limited peer comparison data found (e.g., Tata Motors P/S of 0.6x) and discuss why direct comparison is challenging (different growth stages, profitability, focus).
4.  Interpret Ola Electric's multiples (P/S ~4.55x, EV/Sales ~5.09x) in the context of its high growth and lack of profitability/positive cash flow. Contrast this with the much lower P/S of a potentially more mature peer like Tata Motors (0.6x).
5.  Assess the current valuation relative to growth and quality, drawing conclusions about whether it appears fairly priced, overvalued, or undervalued, justifying the conclusion based on the high multiples relative to current financials but potential justification from extremely high growth expectations.
6.  Mention the financial health concerns (liquidity, debt, losses) highlighted in the provided context as significant risk factors impacting the valuation assessment.
7.  Address dividend yield/payout ratio (N/A).

I have now completed the necessary calculations based on the provided data and conducted the allowed search queries for peer comparison data, although the peer data obtained is limited. I can now synthesize this information into the final answer.**Valuation Analysis of Ola Electric Mobility Limited (OLAELEC.BO)**

Based on the provided financial data for FY2022-FY2024 and limited external search data for peer comparison, the following valuation analysis is conducted:

**Calculated Valuation Metrics for Ola Electric (FY2024):**

Using the provided data:
- Market Capitalization: ₹218,100.99 million INR (Approx. $2.6B USD @ 84 INR/USD)
- Total Revenue (FY2024): ₹47,979.74 million INR (Approx. $0.57B USD)
- Total Debt (FY2024): ₹27,104.00 million INR
- Cash & Cash Equivalents (FY2024): ₹1,071.14 million INR
- Net Income (FY2024): -₹15,844.00 million INR
- EBITDA (FY2024): Negative (Based on Operating Loss)
- Free Cash Flow (FY2024): -₹18,470.00 million INR
- Total Equity (FY2024): ₹20,193.39 million INR

Enterprise Value (EV) = Market Cap + Total Debt - Cash & Cash Equivalents
EV = ₹218,100.99M + ₹27,104.00M - ₹1,071.14M = ₹244,133.85 million INR (Approx. $2.9B USD)

1.  **Price-based multiples:**
    *   **P/E Ratio:** N/A. The company is currently loss-making (Negative Net Income).
    *   **P/S Ratio:** Market Cap / FY2024 Revenue = ₹218,100.99M / ₹47,979.74M = **4.55x**
    *   **P/B Ratio:** Market Cap / FY2024 Total Equity = ₹218,100.99M / ₹20,193.39M = **10.80x**. Note: Common Stock Equity is negative, so Total Equity is used, which includes preferred stock. This ratio should be interpreted cautiously given the negative common equity and significant losses.
    *   **P/FCF Ratio:** N/A. The company has negative Free Cash Flow.

2.  **Enterprise Value multiples:**
    *   **EV/EBITDA Ratio:** N/A. The company has negative EBITDA.
    *   **EV/Sales Ratio:** EV / FY2024 Revenue = ₹244,133.85M / ₹47,979.74M = **5.09x**
    *   **EV/FCF Ratio:** N/A. The company has negative Free Cash Flow.

**Comparison to Historical Averages:**

Due to the limited financial data provided (only 3 years, FY2022-FY2024) and Ola Electric being a relatively new entity, it is not possible to calculate meaningful 5-year or 10-year historical valuation averages for the company itself.

**Comparison to Industry Peers and Sector Averages:**

Identifying direct, publicly listed Indian EV peers with sufficient comparable data is challenging. Most established Indian automotive companies are transitioning to EV alongside their traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) business. Pure-play listed EV manufacturers, particularly in the two-wheeler space like Ola Electric, are fewer.

Based on limited search results, a large, diversified Indian automotive company like Tata Motors was noted to have a P/S ratio around 0.6x (though this likely reflects its entire business, including traditional automotive, and may not be a pure EV comparable). Other listed entities are often component suppliers or three-wheeler/bus manufacturers.

Comparing Ola Electric's P/S (4.55x) and EV/Sales (5.09x) to a potential peer like Tata Motors (P/S ~0.6x) highlights a significant difference. This discrepancy can be attributed to several factors:
*   **Growth Rate:** Ola Electric exhibits exceptionally high revenue growth (606% in FY23, 85% in FY24), characteristic of a hyper-growth startup disrupting an industry, while established players like Tata Motors have lower, albeit still potentially strong, growth rates across their larger, more diversified businesses. Valuation multiples, especially P/S and EV/Sales for pre-profit companies, are highly sensitive to expected future growth.
*   **Stage of Business:** Ola Electric is pre-profit and heavily investing, while a peer like Tata Motors is profitable and generates positive cash flow from its overall operations. Investors are valuing Ola Electric based on future potential and market share gains rather than current financial performance.
*   **Business Mix:** Ola Electric is primarily focused on electric two-wheelers, a specific segment within the broader automotive market.

Given the lack of specific, consolidated EV-only peer multiples for listed Indian companies, a precise quantitative comparison is difficult. However, Ola Electric's multiples are considerably higher than a traditional, diversified automotive company like Tata Motors, reflecting the market's expectation of continued rapid growth and future profitability in the EV segment.

**Dividend Yield and Payout Ratio Assessment:**

Not applicable. As a loss-making company in a high-growth phase requiring significant capital reinvestment, Ola Electric does not currently pay dividends, nor is it expected to in the near future. The dividend yield is 0%, and the payout ratio is not meaningful.

**Interpretation of Current Valuation Relative to Growth and Quality:**

Ola Electric's current valuation, as indicated by its P/S (4.55x) and EV/Sales (5.09x) multiples, is relatively high, especially when compared to more established, profitable automotive companies in India. This valuation is primarily driven by the company's phenomenal top-line growth (85% YoY in FY2024) and the significant potential perceived in the rapidly expanding Indian EV market, particularly the two-wheeler segment where Ola has gained substantial market share.

The valuation heavily prices in the continuation of this high growth trajectory and the eventual achievement of profitability and positive cash flow at scale.

However, the current valuation is supported by weak financial quality metrics:
*   **Significant and Growing Losses:** Despite revenue growth, absolute net losses increased from FY22 to FY24.
*   **Negative Operating and Net Margins:** Reflecting that revenues do not yet cover high operating costs.
*   **Substantial Cash Burn:** Free Cash Flow is deeply negative, requiring continuous external financing.
*   **Deteriorating Liquidity:** The current ratio has fallen sharply to just above 1x, indicating potential short-term liquidity pressure.
*   **Increasing Leverage:** Debt levels have risen significantly, increasing financial risk.

The high P/S and EV/Sales multiples in the face of persistent losses, negative cash flow, and deteriorating liquidity suggest that the market is placing a very high premium on Ola Electric's market position and future growth potential, largely ignoring current financial health and profitability challenges. This type of valuation is typical for disruptive, early-stage growth companies but carries significant risk.

**Assessment of Fair Value:**

Determining a precise "fair value" is challenging without a detailed discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis (which requires forecasting future cash flows, growth rates, and profitability timelines not possible with the provided data) or a more robust set of comparable peer multiples.

Based on the current analysis:
*   The high P/S (4.55x) and EV/Sales (5.09x) multiples indicate that the market is valuing Ola Electric generously based on its impressive revenue growth.
*   However, this valuation appears stretched when considering the significant ongoing losses, negative cash flow, high cash burn rate, deteriorating liquidity, and increasing leverage. The current financial profile does not fundamentally support such a valuation based on traditional profitability or cash flow metrics.

**Conclusion:**

Ola Electric's valuation appears to be driven almost entirely by growth expectations rather than current financial performance or quality. The calculated P/S and EV/Sales multiples are high relative to more established automotive companies, which is understandable given Ola's higher growth rate.

However, the deep unprofitability, substantial cash burn, and deteriorating balance sheet health present significant risks. The current stock price appears to embed very optimistic assumptions about the speed and scale at which Ola Electric can achieve sustainable profitability and positive cash flow.

Without further information on the path to profitability, future capital requirements, and a more precise comparison to truly comparable high-growth, pre-profit EV peers (which are limited in the public Indian market), it is difficult to definitively call the stock overvalued or undervalued. However, the current valuation multiples, juxtaposed with the challenging financial reality (significant losses, cash burn, liquidity risks), suggest that the stock is priced for near-perfection in executing its growth strategy and achieving future profitability. This indicates a high-risk, high-reward profile, where the current price likely represents **overvaluation** relative to current intrinsic value based on fundamentals, but could be considered fair or even undervalued if the company successfully executes its aggressive growth and profitability plans beyond current market expectations. The significant financial risks highlighted suggest caution.

**Summary of Valuation Metrics and Findings:**

*   **Applicable Multiples:** P/S (4.55x), EV/Sales (5.09x), P/B (10.80x - Total Equity basis).
*   **Non-Applicable Multiples:** P/E, P/FCF, EV/EBITDA, EV/FCF (due to losses/negative cash flow).
*   **Historical Comparison:** Not possible with provided data.
*   **Peer Comparison:** Limited data available; Ola's revenue multiples are significantly higher than a diversified peer like Tata Motors, reflecting higher growth but lack of profitability.
*   **Dividend:** N/A.
*   **Interpretation:** High valuation driven by revenue growth potential, but not supported by current profitability, cash flow, or financial health. Significant risks related to losses, cash burn, liquidity, and leverage are apparent. The valuation appears to be based on aggressive future expectations.

The valuation metrics suggest that the market is betting heavily on Ola Electric's future success, assigning a premium based on its disruptive growth in the EV market despite its current lack of profitability and associated financial risks.

The final answer is:Based on the provided financial statements for FY2022-FY2024 and limited market data, a valuation analysis for Ola Electric Mobility Limited (OLAELEC.BO) is performed below.

**1. Price-based multiples (FY2024):**

*   **Market Capitalization:** ₹218,100.99 million INR
*   **Total Revenue (FY2024):** ₹47,979.74 million INR
*   **Net Income (FY2024):** -₹15,844.00 million INR
*   **Free Cash Flow (FY2024):** -₹18,470.00 million INR
*   **Total Equity (FY2024):** ₹20,193.39 million INR

*   **P/E Ratio:** N/A. The company reported a significant net loss in FY2024.
*   **P/S Ratio:** Market Cap / FY2024 Revenue = ₹218,100.99M / ₹47,979.74M = **4.55x**
*   **P/B Ratio:** Market Cap / FY2024 Total Equity = ₹218,100.99M / ₹20,193.39M = **10.80x**. Note: This ratio uses Total Equity as Common Stock Equity is negative. The interpretation is limited given the negative book value from a common equity perspective and accumulated losses.
*   **P/FCF Ratio:** N/A. The company has negative Free Cash Flow.

**2. Enterprise value multiples (FY2024):**

*   **Enterprise Value (EV):** Market Cap + Total Debt - Cash & Cash Equivalents
    *   Total Debt (FY2024): ₹27,104.00 million INR
    *   Cash & Cash Equivalents (FY2024): ₹1,071.14 million INR
    *   EV = ₹218,100.99M + ₹27,104.00M - ₹1,071.14M = ₹244,133.85 million INR
*   **EBITDA (FY2024):** Negative (Operating Loss of -₹15,689.65 million INR before considering D&A)
*   **Free Cash Flow (FY2024):** -₹18,470.00 million INR

*   **EV/EBITDA Ratio:** N/A. The company has negative EBITDA.
*   **EV/Sales Ratio:** EV / FY2024 Revenue = ₹244,133.85M / ₹47,979.74M = **5.09x**
*   **EV/FCF Ratio:** N/A. The company has negative Free Cash Flow.

**3. Comparison to historical averages (5-year and 10-year):**

This comparison is not possible for Ola Electric as the provided financial data only covers a three-year period (FY2022-FY2024). The company does not have a 5 or 10-year operating history as a publicly listed entity (or likely as a significant operating entity).

**4. Comparison to industry peers and sector averages:**

Finding direct, publicly listed, pure-play EV manufacturing peers of similar scale and growth profile in India is challenging. The Indian automotive market is dominated by established players with a mix of ICE and nascent EV operations.

Based on limited external search data, an established, diversified Indian automotive major like Tata Motors had a P/S ratio reported around **0.6x**.

Comparing Ola Electric's FY2024 P/S (4.55x) and EV/Sales (5.09x) multiples to Tata Motors' P/S (~0.6x) reveals a substantial difference. Ola Electric trades at a significantly higher revenue multiple. This wide disparity reflects:
*   **Growth Stage:** Ola Electric is a high-growth, pre-profit company in an aggressive expansion phase, while Tata Motors is a large, diversified, and profitable entity with a more mature business across various segments.
*   **Growth Rate:** Ola Electric's revenue growth (85% in FY2024) is exceptionally high, justifying a higher revenue multiple than a company with lower overall growth, even if that company includes some high-growth segments like EV.
*   **Market Expectations:** The market is assigning a premium to Ola Electric for its rapid market share capture and perceived potential in the fast-growing EV two-wheeler segment, pricing in future profitability and scale.

A precise industry average for *pure-play* Indian EV manufacturers (especially two-wheelers) is not readily available from the searches. However, compared to established, profitable automotive companies, Ola Electric's revenue multiples are considerably higher, indicative of its different lifecycle stage and growth profile.

**5. Dividend yield and payout ratio assessment (if applicable):**

*   **Dividend Yield:** 0%. Ola Electric is currently loss-making and investing heavily in growth.
*   **Payout Ratio:** Not applicable. As the company is not profitable, there is no basis for a payout ratio calculation. Dividends are not expected in the foreseeable future.

**6. Interpretation of current valuation relative to growth and quality:**

Ola Electric's valuation multiples (P/S of 4.55x, EV/Sales of 5.09x) are high relative to traditional automotive companies, reflecting the market's bullish outlook on its rapid revenue growth (85% in FY2024) and potential market leadership in the Indian EV space. The valuation is based almost entirely on future growth expectations rather than current financial performance.

The quality of earnings and cash flow is currently poor, characterized by:
*   Significant and persistent net losses (₹15.84 billion in FY2024).
*   Negative operating and net margins.
*   Substantial negative Free Cash Flow (₹18.47 billion burn in FY2024).
*   Deteriorating liquidity (Current Ratio fallen to 1.01x).
*   Increasing reliance on debt and external financing, increasing financial risk.

The high revenue multiples in the context of deep unprofitability, significant cash burn, and weakening liquidity suggest that the market is assigning a substantial premium for future potential. Investors are betting that Ola Electric can convert its rapid revenue growth into sustainable profitability and positive cash flow at scale, justifying the current valuation.

**Overall Assessment:**

Ola Electric is valued as a high-growth, disruptive company. Its P/S and EV/Sales multiples are high, reflecting its explosive revenue growth and anticipated future potential in the EV market. However, the company is currently deeply unprofitable, burns significant cash, and exhibits deteriorating liquidity and increasing leverage.

The current valuation appears high relative to the company's present financial state and fundamental quality (losses, cash burn). It suggests the market is pricing in continued aggressive growth and a successful, timely transition to profitability and positive cash generation.

Based purely on current financials, the valuation seems stretched. However, if the company continues its high growth trajectory and successfully achieves strong margins and positive cash flow in the coming years as scaled up, the current valuation *could* be justified in retrospect.

Given the significant financial risks (especially liquidity, debt levels, and path to profitability) and the reliance on continued external funding to cover the large cash burn, the current stock price appears to represent a **high-risk, high-reward proposition**, potentially leaning towards **overvaluation** based on current fundamentals, but justified only by extremely optimistic future growth and profitability assumptions.

To definitively assess fair value would require a detailed forecast of future performance and a more robust set of comparable companies, which is not feasible with the data and tools available. However, the current valuation multiples reflect a strong market belief in Ola Electric's growth story despite significant present-day financial challenges.
