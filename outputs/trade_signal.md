Hold. The analysis indicates a significant long-term bearish trend since the 2022 peak, confirmed by a bearish moving average crossover ("death cross") where the shorter-term moving average is below the longer-term moving average. The price has consistently traded below both moving averages, which serve as dynamic resistance, reinforcing the bearish outlook. The RSI analysis notes frequent oversold conditions during the downtrend and is currently fluctuating in a more neutral range, without confirmed bullish divergence noted as a current signal. While the chart shows potential consolidation and testing of support levels in the recent period, the analysis does not confirm a bullish reversal pattern or a break above key resistance levels (such as the declining moving averages). Conversely, although the overall trend is down, the analysis does not specify a recent break below support levels that would trigger a fresh 'Sell' signal. Given the dominant bearish signals from the trend and moving averages, but the lack of a specific, immediate trigger for either initiating a long or short position based on the current consolidation description, the technical strategy suggests a 'Hold' position, advising against initiating a new Buy or Sell trade at this time and waiting for a clearer signal like a confirmed break of support or resistance.
