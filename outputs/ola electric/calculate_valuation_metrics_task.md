Thought: I have performed two searches. The first search provided Ola Electric's market capitalization and mentioned some peers (Ather Energy, TVS Motor). It also gave conflicting market cap figures and highlighted the rapid growth but also the severe financial distress. The second search provided some general insights into automotive valuation multiples and links to reports on industry multiples in India, but it did not provide specific, readily usable P/S or EV/Sales multiples for *direct* Indian EV competitors like Ather Energy or the EV divisions of larger companies like TVS Motor or Bajaj Auto. It did mention general automotive P/S medians which are much lower (e.g., 0.8x from one source), but these likely include traditional, lower-growth, profitable manufacturers and are not directly comparable to a high-growth, loss-making EV startup.

Without specific peer P/S or EV/Sales multiples for directly comparable Indian EV companies, a robust quantitative peer comparison is difficult with the information gathered. I can, however, interpret Ola Electric's calculated multiples (P/S ~4.82x, EV/Sales ~5.36x) in the context of:
1.  Its explosive revenue growth (from ₹3.68 Bn in FY22 to ₹47.98 Bn in FY24).
2.  Its severe lack of profitability and significant cash burn.
3.  General market sentiment for high-growth, disruptive, but loss-making companies.
4.  The significant financial risks identified (negative common equity, high debt, low liquidity).

The multiples of 4.8x P/S and 5.4x EV/Sales are high for a company with low gross margins (8% in FY24) and deep operating/net losses. Such multiples are typically assigned to companies with much higher gross margins, clearer paths to profitability, or significantly lower risk profiles. They reflect the market's optimism about Ola Electric's future revenue potential and market leadership in the Indian EV two-wheeler segment, essentially paying a premium for the projected growth.

However, the valuation seems detached from the current financial reality of significant losses, cash burn, and balance sheet weakness (negative common equity, high debt, low liquidity). The market is betting heavily on future execution and profitability turn-around.

I cannot provide historical averages as the company's public history is too short, and direct peer multiples are not definitively available from the searches. Dividend analysis is not applicable.

Therefore, the analysis will focus on the calculated price and enterprise value to sales multiples, qualitative comparison to growth and risk, and a high-level assessment based on the available information. I have used the two allowed tool calls. I will now structure the final answer based on the available data and analysis.**Valuation Analysis of Ola Electric Mobility Limited (OLAELEC.BO)**

Based on the provided financial data for FY2022-FY2024 and publicly available market data as of recent reports (August 2024, with market cap around ₹23,135 Crore), we can perform a valuation analysis focused primarily on revenue multiples, as the company is not yet profitable.

**1. Price-Based Multiples (FY2024)**

*   **Price-to-Earnings (P/E Ratio):** Not applicable. Ola Electric reported a significant Net Loss of -₹15.84 Billion in FY2024. The P/E ratio is undefined for companies with negative earnings.
*   **Price-to-Sales (P/S Ratio):**
    *   FY2024 Revenue: ₹47.98 Billion INR (as per provided data, assuming units are INR Billions)
    *   Market Capitalization (Approx. as of recent reports): ₹23,135 Crore INR = ₹231.35 Billion INR
    *   Calculated P/S Ratio = Market Cap / FY2024 Revenue = ₹231.35 Billion / ₹47.98 Billion ≈ **4.82x**
    *   *Interpretation:* The calculated P/S ratio is 4.82x based on recent market data and the provided FY2024 revenue. The provided P/S of 3.96 in the initial context suggests a slightly lower market cap or different revenue figure was used previously. Using the calculated 4.82x, investors are paying approximately 4.82 times the company's trailing twelve-month revenue.
*   **Price-to-Book (P/B Ratio):**
    *   Total Equity (FY2024): ₹20.19 Billion INR
    *   Common Stock Equity (FY2024): -₹9.54 Billion INR
    *   Given the negative Common Stock Equity, the traditional P/B ratio based on common equity is not meaningful or negative, indicating that cumulative losses have eroded common shareholder value.
    *   Using Total Equity (which includes preferred stock): Market Cap ₹231.35 Billion / Total Equity ₹20.19 Billion ≈ **11.46x**.
    *   *Interpretation:* A P/B ratio of 11.46x relative to Total Equity is high, but the negative common equity is a critical point. The negative common equity is a significant red flag, indicating severe balance sheet distress from a common shareholder perspective.
*   **Price-to-Free Cash Flow (P/FCF Ratio):** Not applicable. Ola Electric generated significant negative Free Cash Flow ($-18.47 Billion) in FY2024. The P/FCF ratio is not applicable for companies with negative Free Cash Flow.

**2. Enterprise Value Multiples (FY2024)**

*   **Enterprise Value (EV):**
    *   Market Cap: ₹231.35 Billion INR
    *   Total Debt (FY2024): ₹27.10 Billion INR
    *   Cash & Cash Equivalents (FY2024): ₹1.07 Billion INR
    *   EV = Market Cap + Total Debt - Cash & Cash Equivalents
    *   EV = ₹231.35 Billion + ₹27.10 Billion - ₹1.07 Billion ≈ **₹257.38 Billion INR**
*   **EV-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA Ratio):**
    *   EBITDA (FY2024) = Operating Income + Depreciation & Amortization = -₹15.69 Billion + ₹3.58 Billion = -₹12.11 Billion INR
    *   Not applicable. The EV/EBITDA ratio is not typically used for companies with negative EBITDA.
*   **EV-to-Sales (EV/Sales Ratio):**
    *   EV: ₹257.38 Billion INR
    *   FY2024 Revenue: ₹47.98 Billion INR
    *   EV/Sales Ratio = EV / FY2024 Revenue = ₹257.38 Billion / ₹47.98 Billion ≈ **5.36x**
    *   *Interpretation:* The calculated EV/Sales ratio of 5.36x is similar to the P/S ratio, indicating that the company's debt and cash levels do not drastically alter the valuation picture relative to sales. This multiple reflects how the total enterprise value compares to the company's revenue.
*   **EV-to-Free Cash Flow (EV/FCF Ratio):** Not applicable. Ola Electric generated significant negative Free Cash Flow.

**3. Comparison to Historical Averages**

Not applicable. Ola Electric recently became publicly traded, and there is no significant history of publicly available valuation multiples.

**4. Comparison to Industry Peers and Sector Averages**

Finding precise, up-to-date, and directly comparable valuation multiples for Indian EV *peers* (specifically two-wheeler EV manufacturers) is challenging with readily available public data. While major automotive players like TVS Motor and Bajaj Auto have EV offerings, their overall business includes profitable internal combustion engine vehicle sales, making their aggregate multiples less directly comparable to a pure-play, loss-making EV startup like Ola Electric. Another emerging peer, Ather Energy, is also in a high-growth phase, but precise listed multiples for direct comparison were not readily available from the searches conducted within the tool constraints.

However, general industry reports indicate that median P/S multiples for the broader automotive sector can be around 0.8x or higher depending on the segment and growth profile. High-growth, disruptive technology companies, even if loss-making, often command higher revenue multiples than mature, profitable businesses. Ola Electric's calculated P/S of ~4.82x and EV/Sales of ~5.36x are significantly higher than broad automotive medians, which is typical for high-growth, pre-profitability companies in rapidly expanding markets like the Indian EV space. The valuation reflects the market's expectation of continued rapid revenue growth and future profitability.

**5. Dividend Yield and Payout Ratio Assessment**

Not applicable. Ola Electric is currently loss-making and has negative retained earnings/equity. The company is focused on reinvesting cash (or, more accurately, requires significant funding) to fuel growth and is not in a position to pay dividends. Its dividend yield is 0% and its payout ratio is not meaningful.

**6. Interpretation of Current Valuation Relative to Growth and Quality**

*   **Growth:** Ola Electric demonstrates explosive revenue growth, nearly doubling revenue from FY2023 to FY2024 and growing over 13x from FY2022 to FY2024. The current valuation multiples (P/S of ~4.82x, EV/Sales of ~5.36x) are high and clearly price in this significant growth potential. The market is willing to pay a premium based on the assumption that Ola Electric will capture a substantial share of the rapidly growing Indian EV market.
*   **Quality:** Based on the provided financials, the current quality of earnings and the balance sheet health are poor.
    *   **Profitability:** The company is deeply unprofitable at the operating and net levels, with low gross margins relative to its cost structure.
    *   **Liquidity:** Liquidity is critically low, with a current ratio barely above 1 and a quick ratio below 0.3, suggesting potential difficulty meeting short-term obligations.
    *   **Solvency:** Increasing debt and rapidly eroding (and now negative) common equity raise significant solvency concerns. The reliance on external financing (debt and preferred stock) to fund operations and investments is very high.
    *   **Cash Flow:** The persistent and large negative Free Cash Flow indicates a significant cash burn rate, making the company highly dependent on continuous funding rounds.

**Conclusion:**

Ola Electric's current valuation, represented by its P/S ratio of approximately 4.82x and EV/Sales ratio of approximately 5.36x (based on recent market data and FY2024 financials), is notably high, especially considering its deep unprofitability, significant cash burn, weak liquidity, and severe balance sheet issues (including negative common equity).

The valuation is clearly driven by the market's high expectations for future revenue growth and market share in the burgeoning Indian EV sector. Investors are essentially placing a significant bet on the company's ability to continue its rapid top-line expansion and eventually translate that scale into sustainable profitability and positive cash flow.

However, the severe financial distress highlighted by the negative common equity, critically low liquidity, high debt, and massive cash burn represents a significant risk profile. The current stock price appears to reflect aggressive growth assumptions with insufficient consideration for the substantial execution risks and the company's fundamental lack of profitability and financial stability in the present.

Compared to traditional automotive valuations, Ola Electric trades at a significant premium on revenue multiples. While a premium is expected for a high-growth EV player, the magnitude of the premium relative to the current financial losses and risks suggests that the stock is priced for near-perfect execution on growth *and* a successful transition to profitability. Any hiccups in growth, increased competition, or inability to secure future funding could significantly impact this valuation.

Based on a methodical approach combining quantitative metrics (where applicable) and qualitative factors, Ola Electric's current valuation appears to be **overvalued** relative to its current intrinsic value and financial quality, heavily relying on speculative future growth and a successful turnaround to profitability. The high multiples are not supported by current earnings, book value (especially common equity), or free cash flow, placing a significant burden on future performance to justify the present market price. The financial statements show a company burning through capital at an alarming rate, and the valuation does not seem to adequately discount for the high probability of requiring further dilutive funding or facing significant operational/financial challenges.
